Using QPMS library for simulating finite systems
================================================

The main C API for finite systems is defined in [scatsystem.h][], and the
most relevant parts are wrapped into python modules. The central data structure
defining the system of scatterers is [qpms_scatsys_t][],
which holds information about particle positions and their T-matrices
(provided by user) and about the symmetries of the system. Specifically, it
keeps track about the symmetry group and how the particles transform
under the symmetry operations.

Let's have look how thinks are done on a small python script.
The following script is located in `misc/201903_finiterectlat_AaroBEC.py`.

```{.py}
#!/usr/bin/env python
from qpms import Particle, CTMatrix, BaseSpec, FinitePointGroup, ScatteringSystem, TMatrixInterpolator, eV, hbar, c
from qpms.symmetries import point_group_info
import numpy as np
import os
import sys
nm = 1e-9

sym = FinitePointGroup(point_group_info['D2h'])
bspec = BaseSpec(lMax = 2)
tmfile = '/m/phys/project/qd/Marek/tmatrix-experiments/Cylinder/AaroBEC/cylinder_50nm_lMax4_cleaned.TMatrix'
#outputdatadir = '/home/necadam1/wrkdir/AaroBECfinite_new'
outputdatadir = '/u/46/necadam1/unix/project/AaroBECfinite_new'
os.makedirs(outputdatadir, exist_ok = True)
interp = TMatrixInterpolator(tmfile, bspec, symmetrise = sym, atol = 1e-8)
# There is only one t-matrix in the system for each frequency. We initialize the matrix with the lowest frequency data.
# Later, we can replace it using the tmatrix[...] = interp(freq) and s.update_tmatrices NOT YET; TODO

omega = float(sys.argv[3]) * eV/hbar
sv_threshold = float(sys.argv[4])

# Now place the particles and set background index.
px = 571*nm; py = 621*nm
n = 1.51
Nx = int(sys.argv[1])
Ny = int(sys.argv[2])

orig_x = (np.arange(Nx/2) + (0 if (Nx % 2) else .5)) * px
orig_y = (np.arange(Ny/2) + (0 if (Ny % 2) else .5)) * py

orig_xy = np.stack(np.meshgrid(orig_x, orig_y), axis = -1)

tmatrix = interp(omega)
particles = [Particle(orig_xy[i], tmatrix) for i in np.ndindex(orig_xy.shape[:-1])]


ss = ScatteringSystem(particles, sym)


k = n * omega / c


for iri in range(ss.nirreps):
    mm_iri = ss.modeproblem_matrix_packed(k, iri)
    U, S, Vh = np.linalg.svd(mm_iri)
    print(iri, ss.irrep_names[iri], S[-1])
    starti = max(0,len(S) - np.searchsorted(S[::-1], sv_threshold, side='left')-1)
    np.savez(os.path.join(outputdatadir, 'Nx%d_Ny%d_%geV_ir%d.npz'%(Nx, Ny, omega/eV*hbar, iri)),
        S=S[starti:], omega=omega, Vh = Vh[starti:], iri=iri, Nx = Nx, Ny= Ny )
    # Don't forget to conjugate Vh before transforming it to the full vector!
```

Let's have a look at the imports.

```{.py}
from qpms import Particle, CTMatrix, BaseSpec, FinitePointGroup, ScatteringSystem, TMatrixInterpolator, eV, hbar, c
from qpms.symmetries import point_group_info
```

 * `Particle` is a wrapper over the C structure `qpms_particle_t`,
   containing information about particle position and T-matrix.
 * `CTMatrix` is a wrapper over the C structure `qpms_tmatrix_t`,
   containing a T-matrix.
 * `BaseSpec` is a wrapper over the C structure `qpms_vswf_set_spec_t`,
   defining with which subset of VSWFs we are working with and how their
   respective coefficients are ordered in memory. Typically, this 
   just means having all electric and magnetic VSWFs up to a given multipole
   order `lMax` in the "standard" ordering, but other ways are possible.
   Note that different `Particle`s (or, more specifically, `CTMatrix`es)
   can have different `BaseSpec`s and happily coexist in the same 
   `ScatteringSystem`.
   This makes sense if the system contains particles with different sizes,
   where the larger particles need cutoff at higher multipole orders.
 * `FinitePointGroup` is a wrapper over the C structure `qpms_finite_group_t`
   containing info about a 3D point group and its representation. Its contents
   are currently *not* generated using C code. Rather, it is populated using a
   `SVWFPointGroupInfo` instance from the
   `point_group_info` python dictionary, which uses sympy to generate the group
   and its representation from generators and some metadata.
 * `ScatteringSystem` is a wrapper over the C structure `qpms_scatsys_t`,
   mentioned earlier, containing info about the whole structure.
 * `TMatrixInterpolator` in a wrapper over the C structure 
   `qpms_tmatrix_interpolator_t`  which contains tabulated T-matrices 
   (calculated e.g. using [`scuff-tmatrix`][scuff-tmatrix])
   and generates frequency-interpolated T-matrices based on these.
 * `eV`, `hbar`, `c` are numerical constants with rather obvious meanings.
  
Let's go on:
```{.py}
sym = FinitePointGroup(point_group_info['D2h'])
bspec = BaseSpec(lMax = 2)
tmfile = '/m/phys/project/qd/Marek/tmatrix-experiments/Cylinder/AaroBEC/cylinder_50nm_lMax4_cleaned.TMatrix'
...
interp = TMatrixInterpolator(tmfile, bspec, symmetrise = sym, atol = 1e-8)
```

The `D2h` choice indicates that our system will have mirror symmetries along
the *xy*, *xz* and *yz* axes. Using the `BaseSpec` with the standard
constructor with `lMax = 2` we declare that we include all the VSWFs up to
quadrupole order. Next, we create a `TMatrixInterpolator` based on a file
created by `scuff-tmatrix`. We force the symmetrisation of the T-matrices with
the same point group as the overall system symmetry in order to eliminate the
possible asymmetries caused by the used mesh. The `atol` parameter just says
that if the absolute value of a given T-matrix element is smaller than the
`atol` value, it is set to zero.

```{.py}
omega = float(sys.argv[3]) * eV/hbar
sv_threshold = float(sys.argv[4])

# Now place the particles and set background index.
px = 571*nm; py = 621*nm
n = 1.51
Nx = int(sys.argv[1])
Ny = int(sys.argv[2])

orig_x = (np.arange(Nx/2) + (0 if (Nx % 2) else .5)) * px
orig_y = (np.arange(Ny/2) + (0 if (Ny % 2) else .5)) * py

orig_xy = np.stack(np.meshgrid(orig_x, orig_y), axis = -1)

tmatrix = interp(omega)
particles = [Particle(orig_xy[i], tmatrix) for i in np.ndindex(orig_xy.shape[:-1])]

ss = ScatteringSystem(particles, sym)
```
This chunk sets the light frequency and array size based on a command
line argument. Then it generates a list of particles covering a quarter
of a rectangular array. Finally, these particles are used to generate
the final scattering system â€“ the rest of the particles is generated
automatically to satisfy the specified system symmetry.

```{.py}
for iri in range(ss.nirreps):
    mm_iri = ss.modeproblem_matrix_packed(k, iri)
    U, S, Vh = np.linalg.svd(mm_iri)
    print(iri, ss.irrep_names[iri], S[-1])
    starti = max(0,len(S) - np.searchsorted(S[::-1], sv_threshold, side='left')-1)
    np.savez(os.path.join(outputdatadir, 'Nx%d_Ny%d_%geV_ir%d.npz'%(Nx, Ny, omega/eV*hbar, iri)),
        S=S[starti:], omega=omega, Vh = Vh[starti:], iri=iri, Nx = Nx, Ny= Ny )
```
The last part iterates over the irreducible representations of the systems.
It generates scattering problem LHS (TODO ref) matrix reduced (projected)
onto each irrep, and performs SVD on that reduced matrix,
and saving the lowest singular values (or all singular values smaller than
`sv_threshold`) together with their respective singular vectors to files.

The singular vectors corresponding to zero singular values represent the 
"modes" of the finite array.

*TODO analyzing the resulting files.*
