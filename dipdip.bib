	abstract = {The use of exactly solvable Richardson-Gaudin models to describe the physics of systems with strong pair correlations is reviewed. The article begins with a brief discussion of Richardson’s early work, which demonstrated the exact solvability of the pure pairing model, and then shows how that work has evolved recently into a much richer class of exactly solvable models. The Richardson solution leads naturally to an exact analogy between these quantum models and classical electrostatic problems in two dimensions. This analogy is then used to demonstrate formally how BCS theory emerges as the large-N limit of the pure pairing Hamiltonian. Several applications to problems of relevance to condensed-matter physics, nuclear physics, and the physics of confined systems are considered. Some of the interesting effects that are discussed in the context of these exactly solvable models include (i) the crossover from superconductivity to a fluctuation-dominated regime in small metallic grains; (ii) the role of the nucleon Pauli principle in suppressing the effects of high-spin bosons in interacting boson models of nuclei, and (iii) the possibility of fragmentation in confined boson systems. Interesting insight is also provided into the origin of the superconducting phase transition both in two-dimensional electronic systems and in atomic nuclei, based on the electrostatic image of the corresponding exactly solvable quantum pairing models.},

The approach we emphasize is related either to inhomogeneous light-matter strong coupling or to the variety of multimode coupled systems designed for slowing down light or for filtering light. Some semantic caveats are discussed, notably down to what can be termed “dark” and “bright” in as simple a system as a distributed Bragg reflector case. A generic “N-F” classification simply states that whatever the total number N of modes, the key point is the number NF of “prediagonal” families, since the number Nb of bright modes is simply NF leaving Nd=N−NF dark modes.},

For tightly trapped atoms the dipolar interaction energy can be much larger than the photon scattering rate and substantial coherent evolution of the two-atom state can be achieved before decoherence occurs. Excitation of the dipoles can be made conditional on the atomic states, allowing for deterministic generation of entanglement. We derive selection rules and a figure of merit for the dipole-dipole interaction matrix elements, for alkali atoms with hyperfine structure and trapped in localized center of mass states. Different protocols are presented for implementing two-qubit quantum logic gates such as the controlled-phase and swap gates. We analyze the error probability of our gate designs, finite due to decoherence from cooperative spontaneous emission and coherent couplings outside the logical basis.

We obtain expressions for time-dependent intensities and damping rates with the initial conditions (a) both atoms inverted, (b) prior excitation by a short 12π pulse, and (c) only A1 inverted. The results in (a) are compared with those obtained for a model consisting of two initially excited harmonic oscillators O1, O2. The atoms exhibit superradiant behavior, whereas O1, O2 tend to trap radiation. In (a), the intensity pattern ℛ(θ,t) develops lobes in different directions at different times, so that the spatial distribution of photons at time t→∞ is the same as in the independent-atom case r21≫λ. For the oscillators, the lobes of ℛ(θ,t) do not change direction, but only become more pronounced as time increases. In (b) and (c), the lobes oscillate back and forth at frequency 2Ω12 corresponding to the shifts ±Ω12 of the triplet and singlet states due to the A1−A2 interaction. The intensity can therefore have a sinusoidal component. Field correlation functions calculated for (a) and (c) show that A2 and A2 radiate simultaneously around the frequencies ε±Ω12, where ε is the single-atom resonant frequency. The spectrum is calculated for case (c), and shows the effects of coherent linewidth enhancement in addition to the frequency shifts.},

Our final equation thus contains dispersive and superradiant polariton-mediated intermolecular interactions. The effect of the dielectric host is completely contained within a rescaling of these interactions with the transverse dielectric function ε(ω) of the crystal taken at the impurity’s transition frequency. Our theory yields all local field and screening factors for both the dispersive and the dissipative couplings from a single, unified starting point.

Expressions for both radiative lifetimes and frequency shifts are calculated through second order in the electric charge for a fictitious two-level model atom and for a spinless one-electron atom with an infinite number of arbitrarily spaced energy levels. In order to apply the classical ideas of Lorentz to quantum-electrodynamic problems of this kind we work directly with the relevant dynamical variables of the atom and field. The calculations are carried out entirely in the Heisenberg picture by recognizing the importance of radiation reaction. The quantized-field operator equations are integrated with the aid of a Markov approximation. The part of the integrated field that arises from the atomic electron current operator, the radiation-reaction field, is shown to be solely responsible for the atom's linewidths and frequency shifts. It is clear that it is unnecessary to invoke vacuum fluctuations at any stage. The usual quantum electrodynamic exponential decay law is found to govern the expectation values of the energy and dipole moment of the atom as well as the radiated-field amplitude. The theory nevertheless remains unitary. The Heisenberg operator commutation relations are shown to be valid at all times, and the Markov approximation is justified for times longer than a reciprocal transition frequency.},

Some eigenstates decay much faster then the single atom decay rate, while the others undergo very slow decay. We show that virtual processes yield a small effect on the evolution of rapidly decaying states. However, they change the long time dynamics from exponential decay into a power-law behavior which can be observed experimentally. For trapped states virtual processes are much more important yielding additional decay channels which results in a slow decay of the otherwise trapped states.

The system is described in the minimal-coupling scheme and the advantages of this choice for our problem are discussed. The dynamics is investigated using both quantum Langevin equations and Master equation techniques. This last approach allows one to describe the behavior of the atoms plus field system as a one-step process. The case in which both atoms are initially in their excited state and the mode is in its vacuum state is discussed in some detail. It is shown that, different from what occurs to two close atoms in free space, in an overdamped cavity dipolar interaction may modify the decay rate. In particular, we find that the two transitions the atomic system performs to reach its equilibrium configuration can have different rates, and that for a suitable choice of the detuning between the cavity mode and the unperturbed atomic frequency, one of the transitions occurs at an enhanced rate while the second is inhibited.},

In the early 1990s the first atom interferometers opened a new field in which we have been able to use the wave nature of atoms to probe fundamental quantum me chanics questions as well as to make precision measurements. Coming fast on the heels of this development was the demonstration of Bose Einstein condensation in dilute atomic vapors which intensified research interest in studying the wave nature of matter, especially in a domain in which "macro scopic" quantum effects (vortices, stimulated scattering of atomic beams) are visible. At the same time there has been much progress in our understanding of the behavior of waves (notably electromagnetic) in complex media, both periodic and disordered. An obvious topic of speculation and probably of future research is whether any new insight or applications will develop if one examines the behavior of de Broglie waves in analogous situations. Finally, our ability to manipulate atoms has allowed us not only to create macroscopically occupied quantum states but also to exercise fine control over the quantum states of a small number of atoms. This has advanced to the study of quantum entanglement and its relation to the theory of measurement and the theory of information. The 1990s have also seen an explosion of interest in an exciting potential application of this fine control: quantum computation and quantum cryptography.},

The RWA made before the trace is more problematic: it results in incorrect values for environmentally induced shifts to system frequencies, and the resulting theory has no Markovian limit. In either form, the RWA gives an inaccurate quantum state which makes it inappropriate for calculating entanglement dynamics or similar detailed properties of the state dynamics. We also emphasize the fact that even under the RWA the master equation for a combination of systems and external forces is not a simple combination of the master equations of the systems and forces. Such a combination may be tempting, because the RWA guarantees that a master equation so constructed will have a valid mathematical form; however, it will not accurately reflect the dynamics of the physical system. To obtain the correct master equation for the composite system a proper consideration of the non-Markovian dynamics is required.},

The primary mechanism of cooperative emission in such systems is resonant energy transfer between emitters and plasmons rather than the Dicke radiative coupling between emitters. We identify two types of plasmonic coupling between the emitters, (i) plasmon-enhanced radiative coupling and (ii) plasmon-assisted nonradiative energy transfer, the competition between them governing the structure of system eigenstates. Specifically, when emitters are removed by more than several nanometers from the metal surface, the emission is dominated by three superradiant states with the same quantum yield as a single emitter, resulting in a drastic reduction of ensemble radiated energy, while at smaller distances cooperative behavior is destroyed by nonradiative transitions. The crossover between two regimes can be observed in distance dependence of ensemble quantum efficiency. Our numerical calculations incorporating direct and plasmon-assisted interactions between the emitters indicate that they do not destroy the plasmonic Dicke effect.},

	abstract = {Exciton harvesting is demonstrated in an ensemble of quantum emitters coupled to localized surface plasmons. When the interaction between emitters and the dipole mode of a metallic nanosphere reaches the strong coupling regime, the exciton conductance is greatly increased. The spatial map of the conductance matches the plasmon field intensity profile, which indicates that transport properties can be tuned by adequately tailoring the field of the plasmonic resonance. Under strong coupling, we find that pure dephasing can have detrimental or beneficial effects on the conductance, depending on the effective number of participating emitters. Finally, we show that the exciton transport in the strong coupling regime occurs on an ultrafast timescale given by the inverse Rabi splitting (\${\textbackslash}sim10{\textasciitilde}\$fs), orders of magnitude faster than transport through direct hopping between the emitters.},

Surface lattice resonances of the array—hybridized plasmonic-photonic modes—couple strongly to excitons in the dye, and bosonic quasiparticles which we call plasmon-exciton polaritons (PEPs) are formed. By increasing the PEP density through optical pumping, we observe thermalization and cooling of the strongly coupled PEP band in the light emission dispersion diagram. For increased pumping, we observe saturation of the strong coupling and emission in a new weakly coupled band, which again shows signatures of thermalization and cooling.},

	abstract = {The use of computation and simulation has become an essential part of the scientific process. Being able to transform a theory into an algorithm requires significant theoretical insight, detailed physical and mathematical understanding, and a working level of competency in programming.  This upper-division text provides an unusually broad survey of the topics of modern computational physics from a multidisciplinary, computational science point of view. Its philosophy is rooted in learning by doing (assisted by many model programs), with new scientific materials as well as with the Python programming language. Python has become very popular, particularly for physics education and large scientific projects. It is probably the easiest programming language to learn for beginners, yet is also used for mainstream scientific computing, and has packages for excellent graphics and even symbolic manipulations. The text is designed for an upper-level undergraduate or beginning graduate course and provides the reader with the essential knowledge to understand computational tools and mathematical methods well enough to be successful. As part of the teaching of using computers to solve scientific problems, the reader is encouraged to work through a sample problem stated at the beginning of each chapter or unit, which involves studying the text, writing, debugging and running programs, visualizing the results, and the expressing in words what has been done and what can be concluded. Then there are exercises and problems at the end of each chapter for the reader to work on their own (with model programs given for that purpose).},

Variations of the plasmon resonance wavelength, extinction efficiency and width with particle size, array structure, interparticle distance and polarization direction are examined, and conditions which lead to the smallest widths are demonstrated.

	abstract = {The dynamics of a collection of resonant atoms embedded inside an inhomogeneous nondispersive and lossless dielectric is described with a dipole Hamiltonian that is based on a canonical quantization theory. The dielectric is described macroscopically by a position-dependent dielectric function and the atoms as microscopic harmonic oscillators. We identify and discuss the role of several types of Green tensors that describe the spatio-temporal propagation of field operators. After integrating out the atomic degrees of freedom, a multiple-scattering formalism emerges in which an exact Lippmann-Schwinger equation for the electric field operator plays a central role. The equation describes atoms as point sources and point scatterers for light. First, single-atom properties are calculated such as position-dependent spontaneous-emission rates as well as differential cross sections for elastic scattering and for resonance fluorescence. Secondly, multiatom processes are studied. It is shown that the medium modifies both the resonant and the static parts of the dipole-dipole interactions. These interatomic interactions may cause the atoms to scatter and emit light cooperatively. Unlike in free space, differences in position-dependent emission rates and radiative line shifts influence cooperative decay in the dielectric. As a generic example, it is shown that near a partially reflecting plane there is a sharp transition from two-atom superradiance to single-atom emission as the atomic positions are varied.},

We demonstrate that the corresponding capping of the induced loss rate enables collective strong coupling to the dipole mode. Numerical simulations and analytical modeling are applied to several configurations of increasing complexity to grasp the relevant physics. In particular, the emitters closest to the nanoparticle surface are proven to contribute the most to the build-up of the plasmon-exciton polaritons, in contrast with the weak-coupling picture of quenching.},

These results can be accounted for in terms of the pseudomode character of the higher multipole modes of the nanoparticle and the corresponding reduction of the induced loss rate. These findings expand the current understanding of light-matter interaction in plasmonic systems and could contribute to the development of novel quantum plasmonic platforms.},

	abstract = {A formalism for studying spontaneous decay of an excited two-level atom in the presence of dispersing and absorbing dielectric bodies is developed. An integral equation, which is suitable for numerical solution, is derived for the atomic upper-state-probability amplitude. The emission pattern and the power spectrum of the emitted light are expressed in terms of the Green tensor of the dielectric-matter formation, including absorption and dispersion. The theory is applied to the spontaneous decay of an excited atom at the center of a three-layered spherical cavity, with the cavity wall being modeled by a band-gap dielectric of Lorentz type. Both weak and strong coupling are studied, the latter with a special emphasis on cases where the atomic transition is (i) in the normal-dispersion zone near the medium resonance, and (ii) in the anomalous-dispersion zone associated with the band gap. In a single-resonance approximation, conditions of the appearance of Rabi oscillations and closed solutions to the evolution of the atomic state population are derived, which are in good agreement with the exact numerical results.},

We first obtain pronounced Purcell factors and photonic Lamb shifts for both a 7- and 20-nm-radius metal nanoparticle, without adopting a dipole approximation. We then consider a quantum-dot photon emitter positioned sufficiently near the metal nanoparticle so that the strong-coupling regime is possible. Accounting for nondipole interactions, quenching, and photon transport from the dot to the detector, we demonstrate that the strong-coupling regime should be observable in the far-field spontaneous emission spectrum, even at room temperature. The vacuum-induced emission spectra show that the usual vacuum Rabi doublet becomes a rich spectral triplet or quartet with two of the four peaks anticrossing, which survives in spite of significant nonradiative decays. We discuss the emitted light spectrum and the effects of quenching for two different dipole polarizations.},

	url = {http://drum.lib.umd.edu/handle/1903/1141},
	abstract = {We develop exact expressions for translations and rotations of local and
multipole fundamental solutions of the Helmholtz equation in spherical
coordinates. These expressions are based on recurrence relations that we
develop, and to our knowledge are presented here for the first time. The
symmetry and other properties of the coefficients are also examined, and
based on these efficient procedures for calculating them are presented. Our
expressions are direct, and do not use the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients or
the Wigner 3-j symbols, though we compare our results with methods that use
these, to prove their accuracy. We test our expressions on a number of
simple calculations, and show their accuracy. For evaluating a \$N\_t\$ term
truncation of the translation (involving \$O(N\_t{\textasciicircum}2)\$ multipoles), compared to
previous exact expressions that rely on the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients or
the Wigner \$3-j\$ symbol that require \$O(N\_t{\textasciicircum}5)\$ operations, our expressions require \$O(N\_t{\textasciicircum}4)\$) evaluations, with a small constant multiplying the order
term.

The recent trend in evaluating such translations has been to use approximate
"diagonalizations," that require \$O(N\_t{\textasciicircum}3)\$ evaluations with a large
coefficient for the order term. For the Helmholtz equation, these
translations in addition have stabilty problems unless the accuracy of the
truncation and approximate translation are balanced. We derive explicit
exact expressions for achieving "diagonal" translations in  \$O(N\_t{\textasciicircum}3)\$
operations. Our expressions are based on recursive evaluations of multipole
coefficients for rotations, and are accurate and stable, and have a much
smaller coeffiicient for the order term, resulting practically in much fewer
operations. Future use of the developed methods in computational acoustic
scattering, electromagnetic scattering (radar and microwave), optics and
computational biology are expected.

These theorems include a large number of vector addition coefficients. There exist three basic types of analytical expressions for vector translation coefficients: Stein's (Quart. Appl. Math.19, 15 (1961)), Cruzan's (Quart. Appl. Math.20, 33 (1962)), and Xu's (J. Comput. Phys.127, 285 (1996)). Stein's formulation relates vector translation coefficients with scalar translation coefficients. Cruzan's formulas use the Wigner 3jm symbol. Xu's expressions are based on the Gaunt coefficient. Since the scalar translation coefficient can also be expressed in terms of the Gaunt coefficient, the key to the expeditious and reliable calculation of vector translation coefficients is the fast and accurate evaluation of the Wigner 3jm symbol or the Gaunt coefficient. We present highly efficient recursive approaches to accurately evaluating Wigner 3jm symbols and Gaunt coefficients. Armed with these recursive approaches, we discuss several schemes for the calculation of the vector translation coefficients, using the three general types of formulation, respectively. Our systematic test calculations show that the three types of formulas produce generally the same numerical results except that the algorithm of Stein's type is less accurate in some particular cases. These extensive test calculations also show that the scheme using the formulation based on the Gaunt coefficient is the most efficient in practical computations.},

	abstract = {The complete eigenfunction expansion of the electric field dyadic Green's function in spherical coordinates is presented with particular attention given to the significance of the longitudinal eigenfunctions in this expansion. It is shown that the spectrum of the transverse eigenfunctions contribute zero frequency static like modes that cancel the longitudinal modes outside the source region. Inside the source region the cancellation is not complete but the non-cancelling part can be expressed as a delta function contribution in full agreement with the results obtained by Tai by a different method. Various representations for the dyadic Green's function in free space and in a spherical cavity are presented. The paper includes a brief historical survey of the development of the eigenfunction expansion method for the dyadic Green's function in order to highlight some of the early difficulties that were encountered.},

The dyadic Green's function for an unbounded medium is expanded in terms of the spheroidal vector wave functions and the singularity at source points is extracted. The principle of scattering superposition is then applied into the analysis to obtain the scattering spheroidal dyadic Green's functions due to the existing interface. Coupled equation systems satisfied by scattering (i.e., reflection and transmission) coefficients of the dyadic Green's functions are obtained so that these coefficients can be uniquely solved for. The characteristics of the spheroidal dyadic Green's functions as compared with the spherical and cylindrical Green's dyadics are described and the improper developments of the spheroidal dyadic Green's function for the outer region of a conducting spheroid in the existing work are pointed out},

	abstract = {We investigate the optical response of a system consisting of periodic silver V-grooves interacting with quantum emitters. Two surface plasmon-polariton resonances are identified in the reflection spectrum of bare silver grooves, with the intensity of one resonance being localized near the bottom of the groove and that of the other resonance being distributed throughout the entire groove. The linear response of the hybrid silver-emitter system is thoroughly analyzed by considering the coupling between surface plasmon polaritons and emitters as the geometry of the grooves and the spatial distribution of emitters within the grooves are varied. The nonlinear response of the system is also considered by pumping the emitters with a short, high-intensity pulse. By changing the duration or the intensity of the pump, the population of emitters in the ground state at the end of the pump is varied, and it is found (upon probing with a short pulse) that an increase in the fraction of emitters in the ground state corresponds to an increase in Rabi splitting. Spatial variations in the ground state population throughout the emitter region are shown to be a result of field retardation.},
