  abstract = {We show strong coupling involving three different types of resonances in plasmonic nanoarrays: surface lattice resonances (SLRs), localized surface plasmon resonances on single nanoparticles, and excitations of organic dye molecules. The measured transmission spectra show splittings that depend on the molecule concentration. The results are analyzed using finite-difference time-domain simulations, a coupled-dipole approximation, coupled-modes models, and Fano theory. The delocalized nature of the collective SLR modes suggests that in the strong coupling regime molecules near distant nanoparticles are coherently coupled.},

  volume = {6},
  abstract = {The optical constants n and k were obtained for the noble metals (copper, silver, and gold) from reflection and transmission measurements on vacuum-evaporated thin films at room temperature, in the spectral range 0.5-6.5 eV. The film-thickness range was 185-500 {\AA}. Three optical measurements were inverted to obtain the film thickness d as well as n and k. The estimated error in d was {$\pm$} 2 {\AA}, and that in n, k was less than 0.02 over most of the spectral range. The results in the film-thickness range 250-500 {\AA} were independent of thickness, and were unchanged after vacuum annealing or aging in air. The free-electron optical effective masses and relaxation times derived from the results in the near infrared agree satisfactorily with previous values. The interband contribution to the imaginary part of the dielectric constant was obtained by subtracting the free-electron contribution. Some recent theoretical calculations are compared with the results for copper and gold. In addition, some other recent experiments are critically compared with our results.},

  issn = {1748-3387},
  abstract = {Periodic dielectric structures are typically integrated with a planar waveguide to create photonic band-edge modes for feedback in one-dimensional distributed feedback lasers and two-dimensional photonic-crystal lasers. Although photonic band-edge lasers are widely used in optics and biological applications, drawbacks include low modulation speeds and diffraction-limited mode confinement. In contrast, plasmonic nanolasers can support ultrafast dynamics and ultrasmall mode volumes. However, because of the large momentum mismatch between their nanolocalized lasing fields and free-space light, they suffer from large radiative losses and lack beam directionality. Here, we report lasing action from band-edge lattice plasmons in arrays of plasmonic nanocavities in a homogeneous dielectric environment. We find that optically pumped, two-dimensional arrays of plasmonic Au or Ag nanoparticles surrounded by an organic gain medium show directional beam emission (divergence angle {$<$}1.5\textdegree{} and linewidth {$<$}1.3 nm) characteristic of lasing action in the far-field, and behave as arrays of nanoscale light sources in the near-field. Using a semi-quantum electromagnetic approach to simulate the active optical responses, we show that lasing is achieved through stimulated energy transfer from the gain to the band-edge lattice plasmons in the deep subwavelength vicinity of the individual nanoparticles. Using femtosecond-transient absorption spectroscopy, we verified that lattice plasmons in plasmonic nanoparticle arrays could reach a 200-fold enhancement of the spontaneous emission rate of the dye because of their large local density of optical states.},

The paper also rederives the analytical expressions for the vector translational addition coefficients and discusses the strengths and limitations of other formulations and numerical techniques found in the literature.

  abstract = {Vector addition theorems are a necessary ingredient in the analytical solution of electromagnetic multiparticle-scattering problems. These theorems include a large number of vector addition coefficients. There exist three basic types of analytical expressions for vector translation coefficients: Stein's (Quart. Appl. Math.19, 15 (1961)), Cruzan's (Quart. Appl. Math.20, 33 (1962)), and Xu's (J. Comput. Phys.127, 285 (1996)). Stein's formulation relates vector translation coefficients with scalar translation coefficients. Cruzan's formulas use the Wigner 3jm symbol. Xu's expressions are based on the Gaunt coefficient. Since the scalar translation coefficient can also be expressed in terms of the Gaunt coefficient, the key to the expeditious and reliable calculation of vector translation coefficients is the fast and accurate evaluation of the Wigner 3jm symbol or the Gaunt coefficient. We present highly efficient recursive approaches to accurately evaluating Wigner 3jm symbols and Gaunt coefficients. Armed with these recursive approaches, we discuss several schemes for the calculation of the vector translation coefficients, using the three general types of formulation, respectively. Our systematic test calculations show that the three types of formulas produce generally the same numerical results except that the algorithm of Stein's type is less accurate in some particular cases. These extensive test calculations also show that the scheme using the formulation based on the Gaunt coefficient is the most efficient in practical computations.},

Here we report an approach to achieve real-time, tunable lattice plasmon lasing based on arrays of gold nanoparticles and liquid gain materials. Optically pumped arrays of gold nanoparticles surrounded by liquid dye molecules exhibit lasing emission that can be tuned as a function of the dielectric environment. Wavelength-dependent time-resolved experiments show distinct lifetime characteristics below and above the lasing threshold. By integrating gold nanoparticle arrays within microfluidic channels and flowing in liquid gain materials with different refractive indices, we achieve dynamic tuning of the plasmon lasing wavelength. Tunable lattice plasmon lasers offer prospects to enhance and detect weak physical and chemical processes on the nanoscale in real time.},

The formulation assumes that the waves exciting each sphere in the cluster can be described by a regular vector harmonic expansion, centered about a common origin of the cluster, and characterized by an effective propagation constant mek. By combining this description with the multiple sphere interaction equations a `homogeneous' T matrix of the cluster is derived, which is analogous to using the effective propagation constant models of the Varadans in conjunction with Waterman's EBCM. However, it is shown that the homogeneous T matrix will not automatically satisfy energy conservation because it cannot account for dependent scattering effects among the spheres. A `discrete' formulation of the T matrix is then developed which retains the effective medium description of the exciting field yet provides for energy conservation. Illustrative calculations show that the effective medium T matrix can provide accurate predictions of the cross sections and scattering matrices of clusters containing a large number of uniformly packed spheres, yet this approximation uses a fraction of the computational time required for an exact solution.},

  abstract = {A classical problem of free-space Green's function G 0{$\Lambda$} representations of the Helmholtz equation is studied in various quasi-periodic cases, i.e., when an underlying periodicity is imposed in less dimensions than is the dimension of an embedding space. Exponentially convergent series for the free-space quasi-periodic G 0{$\Lambda$} and for the expansion coefficients D L of G 0{$\Lambda$} in the basis of regular (cylindrical in two dimensions and spherical in three dimension (3D)) waves, or lattice sums, are reviewed and new results for the case of a one-dimensional (1D) periodicity in 3D are derived. From a mathematical point of view, a derivation of exponentially convergent representations for Schl{\"o}milch series of cylindrical and spherical Hankel functions of any integer order is accomplished. Exponentially convergent series for G 0{$\Lambda$} and lattice sums D L hold for any value of the Bloch momentum and allow G 0{$\Lambda$} to be efficiently evaluated also in the periodicity plane. The quasi-periodic Green's functions of the Laplace equation are obtained from the corresponding representations of G 0{$\Lambda$} of the Helmholtz equation by taking the limit of the wave vector magnitude going to zero. The derivation of relevant results in the case of a 1D periodicity in 3D highlights the common part which is universally applicable to any of remaining quasi-periodic cases. The results obtained can be useful for the numerical solution of boundary integral equations for potential flows in fluid mechanics, remote sensing of periodic surfaces, periodic gratings, and infinite arrays of resonators coupled to a waveguide, in many contexts of simulating systems of charged particles, in molecular dynamics, for the description of quasi-periodic arrays of point interactions in quantum mechanics, and in various ab initio first-principle multiple-scattering theories for the analysis of diffraction of classical and quantum waves.},

The method uses complex integrals of the resolvent operator, applied to at least k column vectors, where k is the number of eigenvalues inside the contour. The theorem of Keldysh is employed to show that the original nonlinear eigenvalue problem reduces to a linear eigenvalue problem of dimension k. No initial approximations of eigenvalues and eigenvectors are needed. The method is particularly suitable for moderately large eigenvalue problems where k is much smaller than the matrix dimension. We also give an extension of the method to the case where k is larger than the matrix dimension. The quadrature errors caused by the trapezoid sum are discussed for the case of analytic closed contours. Using well known techniques it is shown that the error decays exponentially with an exponent given by the product of the number of quadrature points and the minimal distance of the eigenvalues to the contour.},

High-end imaging lenses have tended to be based on bulk optical components. Advances in fabrication techniques have enabled the development of ultrathin, lightweight, and planar lenses (metalenses) that have unprecedented functionalities. These metalenses have the potential to replace or complement their conventional bulk counterparts. Khorasaninejad and Capasso review the evolution of metalenses, summarizing achievements and applications and identifying future challenges and opportunities. Metalenses can have numerous applications, ranging from cellphone camera modules, to wearable displays for augmented and virtual reality and machine vision, to bio-imaging and endoscopy.

Structured Abstract
BACKGROUNDFuture high-performance portable and wearable optical devices and systems with small footprints and low weights will require components with small form factors and enhanced functionality. Planar components based on diffractive optics (e.g., gratings, Fresnel lenses) and thin-film optics (e.g., dielectric filters, Bragg reflectors) have been around for decades; however, their limited functionality and difficulty of integration have been key incentives to search for better alternatives. Owing to its potential for vertical integration and marked design flexibility, metasurface-based flat optics provides a rare opportunity to overcome these challenges. The building blocks (BBs) of metasurfaces are subwavelength-spaced scatterers. By suitably adjusting their shape, size, position, and orientation with high spatial resolution, one can control the basic properties of light (phase, amplitude, polarization) and thus engineer its wavefront at will. This possibility greatly expands the frontiers of optical design by enabling multifunctional components with attendant reduction of thickness, size, and complexity.
ADVANCESRecent progress in fabrication techniques and in the theory and design of metasurfaces holds promise for this new optical platform (metaoptics) to replace or complement conventional components in many applications. One major advance has been the migration to all-dielectric metasurfaces. Here, we discuss the key advantages of using dielectric phase-shifting elements with low optical loss and strong light confinement in the visible and near-infrared regions as BBs of flat lenses (metalenses). High\textendash{}numerical aperture metalenses that are free of spherical aberrations have been implemented to achieve diffraction-limited focusing with subwavelength resolution, without requiring the complex shapes of aspherical lenses. Achromatic metalenses at discrete wavelengths and over a bandwidth have been realized by dispersion engineering of the phase shifters. By suitably adjusting the geometrical parameters of the latter, one can impart polarization- and wavelength-dependent phases to realize multifunctional metalenses with only one ultrathin layer. For example, polarization-sensitive flat lenses for chiral imaging and circular dichroism spectroscopy with high resolution have been realized, and off-axis metalenses with large engineered angular dispersion have been used to demonstrate miniature spectrometers. The fabrication of metalenses is straightforward and often requires one-step lithography, which can be based on high-throughput techniques such as deep-ultraviolet and nanoimprint lithography.
OUTLOOKIn the near future, the ability to fabricate metalenses and other metaoptical components with a planar process using the same lithographic tools for manufacturing integrated circuits (ICs) will have far-reaching implications. We envision that camera modules widely employed in cell phones, laptops, and myriad applications will become thinner and easier to optically align and package, with metalenses and the complementary metal-oxide semiconductor\textendash{}compatible sensor manufactured by the same foundries. The unprecedented design freedom of metalenses and other metasurface optical components will greatly expand the range of applications of micro-optics and integrated optics. We foresee a rapidly increasing density of nanoscale optical elements on metasurface-based chips, with attendant marked increases in performance and number of functionalities. Such digital optics will probably follow a Moore-like law, similar to that governing the scaling of ICs, leading to a wide range of high-volume applications. {$<$}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/358/6367/eaam8100/F1.medium.gif"/{$>$} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint All-dielectric metalenses.(A) Schematic of a dielectric pillar acting as a truncated waveguide for phase-shifting the incident light.

Recent progress in metasurface designs fueled by advanced-fabrication techniques has led to the realization of ultrathin, lightweight, and flat lenses (metalenses) with unprecedented functionalities. Owing to straightforward fabrication, generally requiring a single-step lithography, and the possibility of vertical integration, these planar lenses can potentially replace or complement their conventional refractive and diffractive counterparts, leading to further miniaturization of high-performance optical devices and systems. Here we provide a brief overview of the evolution of metalenses, with an emphasis on the visible and near-infrared spectrum, and summarize their important features: diffraction-limited focusing, high-quality imaging, and multifunctionalities. We discuss impending challenges, including aberration correction, and also examine current issues and solutions. We conclude by providing an outlook of this technology platform and identifying promising directions for future research.},

  abstract = {We present a numerical investigation of collective resonances in lattices of dielectric nanoparticles. These resonances emerge from the enhanced radiative coupling of localized Mie resonances in the individual nanoparticles. We distinguish two similar systems: a lattice of silicon nanoparticles homogeneously embedded in a dielectric and a lattice of silicon nanoparticles in an optical waveguide. The radiative coupling is provided by diffraction orders in the plane of the array for the former system or by guided modes in the optical waveguide for the latter one. The different coupling leads to distinct lattice resonances in the metasurface defined by the array of silicon nanoparticles. These resonances have been extensively investigated in metallic nanoparticle arrays, but remain highly unexplored in fully dielectric systems. We describe the pronounced differences in the intensity enhancement and field distributions for the two systems, providing valuable information for the design and optimization of optical components based on dielectric lattice resonances.},

  abstract = {This chapter gives a brief overview of plasmonic nanoparticle (NP)-based sensing concepts ranging from classical spectral-shift colorimetry to the highly active field of surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectroscopy. In the last two decades, colloidal approaches have developed significantly. This is seen with, for example, refractive-index sensing, detection of ad-/desorption and ligand-exchange processes, as well as ultrasensitive chemical sensing utilizing well-defined nanocrystals or discrete self-assembled superstructures in 2D and 3D.~Apart from individual NPs, the rational design of self-assembled nanostructures grants spectroscopic access to unprecedented physicochemical information. This involves selected research examples on molecular trapping, ligand corona analysis, SERS-encoding, and biosensing. The origin of the SERS effect, also in regard to hot spot formation by off-resonant excitation, is reviewed and discussed in the context of the current challenge to formulate a generalized metric for high SERS efficiency. Special emphasis lies in addressing the fundamental design criteria and the specific challenges of these particle-based sensing techniques.},

  abstract = {We outline a generalized form of the method-of-moments technique. Integral equation formulations are developed for a diverse class of arbitrarily shaped three-dimensional scatterers. The scatterers may be totally or partially penetrable. Specific cases examined are scatterers with surfaces that are perfectly conducting, dielectric, resistive, or magnetically conducting or that satisfy the Leontovich (impedance) boundary condition. All the integral equation formulations are transformed into matrix equations expressed in terms of five general Galerkin (matrix) operators. This allows a unified numerical solution procedure to be implemented for the foregoing hierarchy of scatterers. The operators are general and apply to any arbitrarily shaped three-dimensional body. The operator calculus of the generalized approach is independent of geometry and basis or testing functions used in the method-of-moments approach. Representative numerical results for a number of scattering geometries modeled by triangularly faceted surfaces are given to illustrate the efficacy and the versatility of the present approach.},

Since it is a time-domain method, FDTD solutions can cover a wide frequency range with a single simulation run and treat nonlinear material properties in a natural way. Written in a tutorial fashion, starting with the simplest programs and guiding the reader up from one-dimensional to the more complex, three-dimensional programs, this book provides a simple, yet comprehensive introduction to the most widely used method for electromagnetic simulation. This fully updated edition presents many new applications, including the FDTD method being used in the design and analysis of highly resonant radio frequency (RF) coils often used for MRI. Each chapter contains a concise explanation of an essential concept and instruction on its implementation into computer code. Projects that increase in complexity are included, ranging from simulations in free space to propagation in dispersive media. Additionally, the text offers downloadable MATLAB and C programming languages from the book support site (http://booksupport.wiley.com). Simple to read and classroom-tested, Electromagnetic Simulation Using the FDTD Method is a useful reference for practicing engineers as well as undergraduate and graduate engineering students.},
