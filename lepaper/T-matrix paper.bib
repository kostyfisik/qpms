  abstract = {One of the most intractable problems in electromagnetic multisphere-scattering theory is the formulation and evaluation of vector addition coefficients introduced by the addition theorems for vector spherical harmonics. This paper presents an efficient approach for the calculation of both scalar and vector translational addition coefficients, which is based on fast evaluation of the Gaunt coefficients. The paper also rederives the analytical expressions for the vector translational addition coefficients and discusses the strengths and limitations of other formulations and numerical techniques found in the literature. Numerical results from the formulation derived in this paper agree with those of a previously published recursion scheme that completely avoids the use of the Gaunt coefficients, but the method of direct calculation proposed here reduces the computing time by a factor of 4\textendash{}6.},

  issn = {0021-9991},
  abstract = {Vector addition theorems are a necessary ingredient in the analytical solution of electromagnetic multiparticle-scattering problems. These theorems include a large number of vector addition coefficients. There exist three basic types of analytical expressions for vector translation coefficients: Stein's (Quart. Appl. Math.19, 15 (1961)), Cruzan's (Quart. Appl. Math.20, 33 (1962)), and Xu's (J. Comput. Phys.127, 285 (1996)). Stein's formulation relates vector translation coefficients with scalar translation coefficients. Cruzan's formulas use the Wigner 3jm symbol. Xu's expressions are based on the Gaunt coefficient. Since the scalar translation coefficient can also be expressed in terms of the Gaunt coefficient, the key to the expeditious and reliable calculation of vector translation coefficients is the fast and accurate evaluation of the Wigner 3jm symbol or the Gaunt coefficient. We present highly efficient recursive approaches to accurately evaluating Wigner 3jm symbols and Gaunt coefficients. Armed with these recursive approaches, we discuss several schemes for the calculation of the vector translation coefficients, using the three general types of formulation, respectively. Our systematic test calculations show that the three types of formulas produce generally the same numerical results except that the algorithm of Stein's type is less accurate in some particular cases. These extensive test calculations also show that the scheme using the formulation based on the Gaunt coefficient is the most efficient in practical computations.},

The scattering of light by spherical particles can be easily computed using the conventional Mie theory.

Yet this approach requires only a negligibly small extra memory, an affordable increase in CPU time consumption, and practically no additional programming effort.

The formulation assumes that the waves exciting each sphere in the cluster can be described by a regular vector harmonic expansion, centered about a common origin of the cluster, and characterized by an effective propagation constant mek. By combining this description with the multiple sphere interaction equations a `homogeneous' T matrix of the cluster is derived, which is analogous to using the effective propagation constant models of the Varadans in conjunction with Waterman's EBCM. However, it is shown that the homogeneous T matrix will not automatically satisfy energy conservation because it cannot account for dependent scattering effects among the spheres. A `discrete' formulation of the T matrix is then developed which retains the effective medium description of the exciting field yet provides for energy conservation. Illustrative calculations show that the effective medium T matrix can provide accurate predictions of the cross sections and scattering matrices of clusters containing a large number of uniformly packed spheres, yet this approximation uses a fraction of the computational time required for an exact solution.},

  abstract = {A classical problem of free-space Green's function G 0{$\Lambda$} representations of the Helmholtz equation is studied in various quasi-periodic cases, i.e., when an underlying periodicity is imposed in less dimensions than is the dimension of an embedding space. Exponentially convergent series for the free-space quasi-periodic G 0{$\Lambda$} and for the expansion coefficients D L of G 0{$\Lambda$} in the basis of regular (cylindrical in two dimensions and spherical in three dimension (3D)) waves, or lattice sums, are reviewed and new results for the case of a one-dimensional (1D) periodicity in 3D are derived. From a mathematical point of view, a derivation of exponentially convergent representations for Schl{\"o}milch series of cylindrical and spherical Hankel functions of any integer order is accomplished. Exponentially convergent series for G 0{$\Lambda$} and lattice sums D L hold for any value of the Bloch momentum and allow G 0{$\Lambda$} to be efficiently evaluated also in the periodicity plane. The quasi-periodic Green's functions of the Laplace equation are obtained from the corresponding representations of G 0{$\Lambda$} of the Helmholtz equation by taking the limit of the wave vector magnitude going to zero. The derivation of relevant results in the case of a 1D periodicity in 3D highlights the common part which is universally applicable to any of remaining quasi-periodic cases. The results obtained can be useful for the numerical solution of boundary integral equations for potential flows in fluid mechanics, remote sensing of periodic surfaces, periodic gratings, and infinite arrays of resonators coupled to a waveguide, in many contexts of simulating systems of charged particles, in molecular dynamics, for the description of quasi-periodic arrays of point interactions in quantum mechanics, and in various ab initio first-principle multiple-scattering theories for the analysis of diffraction of classical and quantum waves.},

  abstract = {The accurate and efficient computation of lattice sums for the three-dimensional Helmholtz equation is considered for the cases where the underlying lattice is one- or two-dimensional. We demonstrate, using careful numerical computations, that the reduction method, in which the sums for a two-dimensional lattice are expressed as a sum of one-dimensional lattice sums leads to an order-of-magnitude improvement in performance over the well-known Ewald method. In the process we clarify and improve on a number of results originally formulated by Twersky in the 1970s.},

  abstract = {We study lasing at the high-symmetry points of the Brillouin zone in a honeycomb plasmonic lattice. We use symmetry arguments to define singlet and doublet modes at the K points of the reciprocal space. We experimentally demonstrate lasing at the K points that is based on plasmonic lattice modes and two-dimensional feedback. By comparing polarization properties to T-matrix simulations, we identify the lasing mode as one of the singlets with an energy minimum at the K point enabling feedback. Our results offer prospects for studies of topological lasing in radiatively coupled systems.},

  isbn = {978-1-61353-221-8},
  abstract = {This book is an introduction to some of the most important properties of electromagnetic waves and their interaction with passive materials and scatterers. The main purpose of the book is to give a theoretical treatment of these scattering phenomena, and to illustrate numerical computations of some canonical scattering problems for different geometries and materials. The scattering theory is also important in the theory of passive antennas, and this book gives several examples on this topic. Topics covered include an introduction to the basic equations used in scattering; the Green functions and dyadics; integral representation of fields; introductory scattering theory; scattering in the time domain; approximations and applications; spherical vector waves; scattering by spherical objects; the null-field approach; and propagation in stratified media. The book is organised along two tracks, which can be studied separately or together. Track 1 material is appropriate for a first reading of the textbook, while Track 2 contains more advanced material suited for the second reading and for reference. Exercises are included for each chapter.},
