TODO label description
======================

LMAXVAR - besides to int, the function should support an iterable for the lMax argument or similar, and
          in such case the output should have the according additional dimension. In the end, I want
          to support systems where different nanoparticles have different lMax.

VECTORIZE - add support to process more than one element at once, in general.

FEATURE - non-urgent general feature to implement
