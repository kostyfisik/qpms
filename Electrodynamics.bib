	abstract = {We provide a self-consistent electromagnetic theory of the coupling between dipole emitters and dissipative nanoresonators. The theory that relies on the concept of quasinormal modes with complex frequencies provides an accurate closed-form expression for the electromagnetic local density of states of any photonic or plasmonic resonator with strong radiation leakage, absorption, and material dispersion. It represents a powerful tool to calculate and conceptualize the electromagnetic response of systems that are governed by a small number of resonance modes. We use the formalism to revisit Purcell’s factor. The new formula substantially differs from the usual one; in particular, it predicts that a spectral detuning between the emitter and the resonance does not necessarily result in a Lorentzian response in the presence of dissipation. Comparisons with fully vectorial numerical calculations for plasmonic nanoresonators made of gold nanorods evidence the high accuracy of the predictions achieved by our semianalytical treatment.},

	abstract = {We develop a theory of cooperative emission of light by an ensemble of emitters, such as fluorescing molecules or semiconductor quantum dots, located near a metal nanostructure supporting surface plasmon. The primary mechanism of cooperative emission in such systems is resonant energy transfer between emitters and plasmons rather than the Dicke radiative coupling between emitters. We identify two types of plasmonic coupling between the emitters, (i) plasmon-enhanced radiative coupling and (ii) plasmon-assisted nonradiative energy transfer, the competition between them governing the structure of system eigenstates. Specifically, when emitters are removed by more than several nanometers from the metal surface, the emission is dominated by three superradiant states with the same quantum yield as a single emitter, resulting in a drastic reduction of ensemble radiated energy, while at smaller distances cooperative behavior is destroyed by nonradiative transitions. The crossover between two regimes can be observed in distance dependence of ensemble quantum efficiency. Our numerical calculations incorporating direct and plasmon-assisted interactions between the emitters indicate that they do not destroy the plasmonic Dicke effect.},

It presents, for the first time, a rigorous numerical simulation of some of the key results, along with new experimental findings and also physical interpretations of the results. In an optical trap particles are attracted close to areas of high optical intensities and intensity gradients. So, for example, if two lasers are pointed towards each other (a counter propagating trap) then a single particle is trapped in the centre of the two beams – the system is analogous to a particle being held by two springs in a potential well. If one increases the number of particles in the trap then naively one would expect all the particles to collect in the centre of the well. However, the effect of optical binding means that the presence of one particle affects the distribution of light experienced by another particle, resulting in extremely complex interactions that can lead to unusual 1D and 2D structures to form within the trap. Optical binding is not only of theoretical interest but also has applications in micromanipulation and assembly.},

	url = {http://drum.lib.umd.edu/handle/1903/1141},
	abstract = {We develop exact expressions for translations and rotations of local and
multipole fundamental solutions of the Helmholtz equation in spherical
coordinates. These expressions are based on recurrence relations that we
develop, and to our knowledge are presented here for the first time. The
symmetry and other properties of the coefficients are also examined, and
based on these efficient procedures for calculating them are presented. Our
expressions are direct, and do not use the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients or
the Wigner 3-j symbols, though we compare our results with methods that use
these, to prove their accuracy. We test our expressions on a number of
simple calculations, and show their accuracy. For evaluating a \$N\_t\$ term
truncation of the translation (involving \$O(N\_t{\textasciicircum}2)\$ multipoles), compared to
previous exact expressions that rely on the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients or
the Wigner \$3-j\$ symbol that require \$O(N\_t{\textasciicircum}5)\$ operations, our expressions require \$O(N\_t{\textasciicircum}4)\$) evaluations, with a small constant multiplying the order
term.

The recent trend in evaluating such translations has been to use approximate
"diagonalizations," that require \$O(N\_t{\textasciicircum}3)\$ evaluations with a large
coefficient for the order term. For the Helmholtz equation, these
translations in addition have stabilty problems unless the accuracy of the
truncation and approximate translation are balanced. We derive explicit
exact expressions for achieving "diagonal" translations in  \$O(N\_t{\textasciicircum}3)\$
operations. Our expressions are based on recursive evaluations of multipole
coefficients for rotations, and are accurate and stable, and have a much
smaller coeffiicient for the order term, resulting practically in much fewer
operations. Future use of the developed methods in computational acoustic
scattering, electromagnetic scattering (radar and microwave), optics and
computational biology are expected.

These theorems include a large number of vector addition coefficients. There exist three basic types of analytical expressions for vector translation coefficients: Stein's (Quart. Appl. Math.19, 15 (1961)), Cruzan's (Quart. Appl. Math.20, 33 (1962)), and Xu's (J. Comput. Phys.127, 285 (1996)). Stein's formulation relates vector translation coefficients with scalar translation coefficients. Cruzan's formulas use the Wigner 3jm symbol. Xu's expressions are based on the Gaunt coefficient. Since the scalar translation coefficient can also be expressed in terms of the Gaunt coefficient, the key to the expeditious and reliable calculation of vector translation coefficients is the fast and accurate evaluation of the Wigner 3jm symbol or the Gaunt coefficient. We present highly efficient recursive approaches to accurately evaluating Wigner 3jm symbols and Gaunt coefficients. Armed with these recursive approaches, we discuss several schemes for the calculation of the vector translation coefficients, using the three general types of formulation, respectively. Our systematic test calculations show that the three types of formulas produce generally the same numerical results except that the algorithm of Stein's type is less accurate in some particular cases. These extensive test calculations also show that the scheme using the formulation based on the Gaunt coefficient is the most efficient in practical computations.},

We calculate the exact eigenoperators for the coupled system and express the electromagnetic field operators in terms of them. The dielectric constant of the medium is explicitly derived and is shown to satisfy the Kramers-Kronig relations. We apply these results to treat the propagation of light in dielectrics and obtain simple expressions for the electromagnetic field in the medium in terms of space-dependent creation and annihilation operators. These operators satisfy a set of equal-space commutation relations and obey spatial Langevin equations of evolution. This justifies the use of such operators in phenomenological models in quantum optics. We also obtain two interesting relationships between the group and the phase velocity in dielectrics.},

A more complete theory is developed. It is shown that excitons are approximate bosons, and, in interaction with the electromagnetic field, the exciton field plays the role of the classical polarization field. The eigenstates of the system of crystal and radiation field are mixtures of photons and excitons. The ordinary one-quantum optical lifetime of an excitation is infinite. Absorption occurs only when "three-body" processes are introduced. The theory includes "local field" effects, leading to the Lorentz local field correction when it is applicable. A Smakula equation for the oscillator strength in terms of the integrated absorption constant is derived.},

Starting from the phenomenological Maxwell equations, where the properties of the dielectric are described by a permittivity consistent with the Kramers-Kronig relations, an expansion of the field operators is performed that is based on the Green function of the classical Maxwell equations and preserves the equal-time canonical field commutation relations. In particular, in frequency intervals with approximately vanishing absorption the concept of quantization through mode expansion for dispersive dielectrics is recognized. The theory further reveals that weak absorption gives rise to space-dependent mode operators that spatially evolve according to quantum Langevin equations in the space domain. To illustrate the applicability of the theory to inhomogeneous structures, the quantization of the radiation field in a dispersive and absorptive one-interface dielectric is performed. © 1996 The American Physical Society.},
