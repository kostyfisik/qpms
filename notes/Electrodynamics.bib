  abstract = {We present a fully canonical quantization scheme for the electromagnetic field in dispersive and lossy linear dielectrics. This scheme is based on a microscopic model, in which the medium is represented by a collection of interacting matter fields. We calculate the exact eigenoperators for the coupled system and express the electromagnetic field operators in terms of them. The dielectric constant of the medium is explicitly derived and is shown to satisfy the Kramers-Kronig relations. We apply these results to treat the propagation of light in dielectrics and obtain simple expressions for the electromagnetic field in the medium in terms of space-dependent creation and annihilation operators. These operators satisfy a set of equal-space commutation relations and obey spatial Langevin equations of evolution. This justifies the use of such operators in phenomenological models in quantum optics. We also obtain two interesting relationships between the group and the phase velocity in dielectrics.},

The theory that relies on the concept of quasinormal modes with complex frequencies provides an accurate closed-form expression for the electromagnetic local density of states of any photonic or plasmonic resonator with strong radiation leakage, absorption, and material dispersion. It represents a powerful tool to calculate and conceptualize the electromagnetic response of systems that are governed by a small number of resonance modes. We use the formalism to revisit Purcell's factor. The new formula substantially differs from the usual one; in particular, it predicts that a spectral detuning between the emitter and the resonance does not necessarily result in a Lorentzian response in the presence of dissipation. Comparisons with fully vectorial numerical calculations for plasmonic nanoresonators made of gold nanorods evidence the high accuracy of the predictions achieved by our semianalytical treatment.},

  abstract = {We develop a theory of cooperative emission of light by an ensemble of emitters, such as fluorescing molecules or semiconductor quantum dots, located near a metal nanostructure supporting surface plasmon. The primary mechanism of cooperative emission in such systems is resonant energy transfer between emitters and plasmons rather than the Dicke radiative coupling between emitters. We identify two types of plasmonic coupling between the emitters, (i) plasmon-enhanced radiative coupling and (ii) plasmon-assisted nonradiative energy transfer, the competition between them governing the structure of system eigenstates. Specifically, when emitters are removed by more than several nanometers from the metal surface, the emission is dominated by three superradiant states with the same quantum yield as a single emitter, resulting in a drastic reduction of ensemble radiated energy, while at smaller distances cooperative behavior is destroyed by nonradiative transitions. The crossover between two regimes can be observed in distance dependence of ensemble quantum efficiency. Our numerical calculations incorporating direct and plasmon-assisted interactions between the emitters indicate that they do not destroy the plasmonic Dicke effect.},

  abstract = {We develop exact expressions for translations and rotations of local and
multipole fundamental solutions of the Helmholtz equation in spherical
coordinates. These expressions are based on recurrence relations that we
develop, and to our knowledge are presented here for the first time. The
symmetry and other properties of the coefficients are also examined, and
based on these efficient procedures for calculating them are presented. Our
expressions are direct, and do not use the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients or
the Wigner 3-j symbols, though we compare our results with methods that use
these, to prove their accuracy. We test our expressions on a number of
simple calculations, and show their accuracy. For evaluating a \$N\_t\$ term
truncation of the translation (involving \$O(N\_t\^2)\$ multipoles), compared to
previous exact expressions that rely on the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients or
the Wigner \$3-j\$ symbol that require \$O(N\_t\^5)\$ operations, our expressions require \$O(N\_t\^4)\$) evaluations, with a small constant multiplying the order
term.

The recent trend in evaluating such translations has been to use approximate
"diagonalizations," that require \$O(N\_t\^3)\$ evaluations with a large
coefficient for the order term. For the Helmholtz equation, these
translations in addition have stabilty problems unless the accuracy of the
truncation and approximate translation are balanced. We derive explicit
exact expressions for achieving "diagonal" translations in  \$O(N\_t\^3)\$
operations. Our expressions are based on recursive evaluations of multipole
coefficients for rotations, and are accurate and stable, and have a much
smaller coeffiicient for the order term, resulting practically in much fewer
operations. Future use of the developed methods in computational acoustic
scattering, electromagnetic scattering (radar and microwave), optics and
computational biology are expected.

These theorems include a large number of vector addition coefficients. There exist three basic types of analytical expressions for vector translation coefficients: Stein's (Quart. Appl. Math.19, 15 (1961)), Cruzan's (Quart. Appl. Math.20, 33 (1962)), and Xu's (J. Comput. Phys.127, 285 (1996)). Stein's formulation relates vector translation coefficients with scalar translation coefficients. Cruzan's formulas use the Wigner 3jm symbol. Xu's expressions are based on the Gaunt coefficient. Since the scalar translation coefficient can also be expressed in terms of the Gaunt coefficient, the key to the expeditious and reliable calculation of vector translation coefficients is the fast and accurate evaluation of the Wigner 3jm symbol or the Gaunt coefficient. We present highly efficient recursive approaches to accurately evaluating Wigner 3jm symbols and Gaunt coefficients. Armed with these recursive approaches, we discuss several schemes for the calculation of the vector translation coefficients, using the three general types of formulation, respectively. Our systematic test calculations show that the three types of formulas produce generally the same numerical results except that the algorithm of Stein's type is less accurate in some particular cases. These extensive test calculations also show that the scheme using the formulation based on the Gaunt coefficient is the most efficient in practical computations.},

  abstract = {This thesis addresses optical binding - a new area of interest within the field of optical micromanipulation. It presents, for the first time, a rigorous numerical simulation of some of the key results, along with new experimental findings and also physical interpretations of the results. In an optical trap particles are attracted close to areas of high optical intensities and intensity gradients. So, for example, if two lasers are pointed towards each other (a counter propagating trap) then a single particle is trapped in the centre of the two beams \textendash{} the system is analogous to a particle being held by two springs in a potential well. If one increases the number of particles in the trap then naively one would expect all the particles to collect in the centre of the well. However, the effect of optical binding means that the presence of one particle affects the distribution of light experienced by another particle, resulting in extremely complex interactions that can lead to unusual 1D and 2D structures to form within the trap. Optical binding is not only of theoretical interest but also has applications in micromanipulation and assembly.},

A more complete theory is developed. It is shown that excitons are approximate bosons, and, in interaction with the electromagnetic field, the exciton field plays the role of the classical polarization field. The eigenstates of the system of crystal and radiation field are mixtures of photons and excitons. The ordinary one-quantum optical lifetime of an excitation is infinite. Absorption occurs only when "three-body" processes are introduced. The theory includes "local field" effects, leading to the Lorentz local field correction when it is applicable. A Smakula equation for the oscillator strength in terms of the integrated absorption constant is derived.},

  abstract = {A quantization scheme for the radiation field in dispersive and absorptive linear dielectrics is developed, which applies to both bulk material and multilayer dielectric structures. Starting from the phenomenological Maxwell equations, where the properties of the dielectric are described by a permittivity consistent with the Kramers-Kronig relations, an expansion of the field operators is performed that is based on the Green function of the classical Maxwell equations and preserves the equal-time canonical field commutation relations. In particular, in frequency intervals with approximately vanishing absorption the concept of quantization through mode expansion for dispersive dielectrics is recognized. The theory further reveals that weak absorption gives rise to space-dependent mode operators that spatially evolve according to quantum Langevin equations in the space domain. To illustrate the applicability of the theory to inhomogeneous structures, the quantization of the radiation field in a dispersive and absorptive one-interface dielectric is performed. \textcopyright{} 1996 The American Physical Society.},

It is demonstrated that calculating the T-matrix using extended-precision instead of double-precision floating-point variables is an effective approach for suppressing the numerical instability in computations for spheroids and allows one to increase the maximum particle size parameter for which T-matrix computations converge by as significant a factor as 2\textendash{}2.7. Yet this approach requires only a negligibly small extra memory, an affordable increase in CPU time consumption, and practically no additional programming effort. As a result, the range of particle size parameters, for which rigorous T-matrix computations of spheroidal scattering can be performed, now covers a substantial fraction of the gap between the domains of applicability of the Rayleigh and geometrical optics approximations.},

  abstract = {The solution of electromagnetic scattering by a homogeneous prolate (or oblate) spheroidal particle with an arbitrary size and refractive index is obtained for any angle of incidence by solving Maxwell's equations under given boundary conditions. The method used is that of separating the vector wave equations in the spheroidal coordinates and expanding them in terms of the spheroidal wavefunctions. The unknown coefficients for the expansion are determined by a system of equations derived from the boundary conditions regarding the continuity of tangential components of the electric and magnetic vectors across the surface of the spheroid. The solutions both in the prolate and oblate spheroidal coordinate systems result in a same form, and the equations for the oblate spheroidal system can be obtained from those for the prolate one by replacing the prolate spheroidal wavefunctions with the oblate ones and vice versa. For an oblique incidence, the polarized incident wave is resolved into two components, the TM mode for which the magnetic vector vibrates perpendicularly to the incident plane and the TE mode for which the electric vector vibrates perpendicularly to this plane. For the incidence along the rotation axis the resultant equations are given in the form similar to the one for a sphere given by the Mie theory. The physical parameters involved are the following five quantities: the size parameter defined by the product of the semifocal distance of the spheroid and the propagation constant of the incident wave, the eccentricity, the refractive index of the spheroid relative to the surrounding medium, the incident angle between the direction of the incident wave and the rotation axis, and the angles that specify the direction of the scattered wave.},

There are two different aspects to the problem. The first aspect concerns a case where the imaginary part of the size parameters remains small. Shown here is the possibility for avoiding the canonical recommendations which prescribe using both upward and downward recursions for different types of Bessel functions. We have justified the procedure based on the upward recursions only where results are as stable as those in the canonical one. The second aspect concerns the case with a large imaginary part of the size parameter. The calculation procedure for a multilayered particle fails in such a case because of 0/0-type uncertainty. However, this problem can be overcome by using the proper asymptotic relations at crucial points. The numerical results are demonstrated for spherical and cylindrical multilayered particles.},

  abstract = {Two numerical methods to model light scattering from illuminated features on surfaces are presented. The discrete-dipole approximation (DDA) method is considered, as well as the modified double interaction method (MDIM). The DDA method models electromagnetic scattering of continuous features using discrete dipoles placed on a lattice structure. Sommerfeld integral terms are used to model dipole/surface interaction in the near-field. The MDIM method first computes scattering from the features based in free space using other methods such as Mie theory or other standard light scattering codes (including DDA). The surface interaction is modeled as a first approximation by means of a geometrical shadowing effect and the Fresnel coefficients. Comparisons of the methods will be shown for light scattering from spherical features. The material properties of dielectric and metallic materials will be considered and the feature sizes will be varied. The prediction accuracy and computational requirements of each method will be investigated. For most cases, the studies will show that the DDA method is more accurate than the MDIM method for dielectric materials since the modeling of the feature and surface electromagnetic interaction is more accurate; however, the modified double interaction method may be advantageous over the discrete-dipole approximation method for metallic features because of lesser computational times and memory requirements.},

  abstract = {An effective medium approach is developed for describing the radiative scattering characteristics of large-scale clusters of spheres. The formulation assumes that the waves exciting each sphere in the cluster can be described by a regular vector harmonic expansion, centered about a common origin of the cluster, and characterized by an effective propagation constant mek. By combining this description with the multiple sphere interaction equations a `homogeneous' T matrix of the cluster is derived, which is analogous to using the effective propagation constant models of the Varadans in conjunction with Waterman's EBCM. However, it is shown that the homogeneous T matrix will not automatically satisfy energy conservation because it cannot account for dependent scattering effects among the spheres. A `discrete' formulation of the T matrix is then developed which retains the effective medium description of the exciting field yet provides for energy conservation. Illustrative calculations show that the effective medium T matrix can provide accurate predictions of the cross sections and scattering matrices of clusters containing a large number of uniformly packed spheres, yet this approximation uses a fraction of the computational time required for an exact solution.},

  shorttitle = {Light-Scattering Properties of Fractal Aggregates},
  abstract = {Dust particles in space often grow by mutual collisions and appear to be an agglomeration of individual grains, the morphology of which can be described by the concept of fractals. In this paper, we study light scattering by fractal aggregates of identical spheres (monomers) using the superposition technique incorporated into the T-matrix method where the orientationally averaged scattering matrix is analytically obtained. We also apply the discrete-dipole approximation, in which the dipole polarizability of spherical monomers is determined by the first term of the scattering coefficients in the Mie theory. Two cases of the ballistic aggregation process (particle\textendash{}cluster and cluster\textendash{}cluster aggregations) are considered to model fractal aggregates consisting of silicate or carbon material. The dependences of light-scattering properties on the monomer sizes, aggregate structures and material compositions are intensively investigated. The light-scattering properties of the fractal aggregates strongly depend on the size parameters of the monomers. The difference in the scattering function between the particle\textendash{}cluster and cluster\textendash{}cluster aggregates can be seen in the case of monomers much smaller than the wavelength of incident radiation. When the size parameter of monomers exceeds unity, the material composition of the monomers influences the light-scattering properties of the aggregates, but different morphologies result in similar scattering and polarization patterns. We show that silicate aggregates consisting of submicron-sized monomers, irrespective of the aggregate size and morphology, produce a backscattering enhancement and a negative polarization observed for dust in the solar system.},

  abstract = {Absorption and extinction properties of the finite hexagonal ice column and hexagonal ice plate in random and preferred orientation are studied at the wavelength of 80 {$\mu$}m using a new implementation of exact T-matrix theory. For the case of random orientation at size parameters around two, it is shown that the hexagonal ice column and hexagonal ice plate absorption resonances are diminished relative to Mie theory, and the same behaviour is also noted for an aggregate particle consisting of eight hexagonal elements. The absorption properties of the aggregate particle have been calculated using the finite-difference time-domain method. It is also shown that extinction and absorption solutions for the hexagonal ice column and hexagonal ice plate can differ significantly if incidence occurs perpendicular or parallel to the cylindrical axis of the hexagon. For the case of perpendicular incidence on the edge of the hexagon, absorption solutions can exceed those of Mie theory, and for the case of parallel incidence, behaviour of the extinction solutions for hexagonal ice columns and hexagonal ice plates is shown to be similar to previously published work based on the prolate and oblate spheroid. Interference structure, associated with surface waves, is resolved on the hexagonal column extinction solution and the hexagonal plate absorption solution, thereby demonstrating that surface waves can exist on a non-axisymmetric geometry. The usefulness of assuming the hexagonal ice column in retrieval of ice crystal effective size is also investigated using aircraft based radiometric observations of semi-transparent cirrus at the wavelengths of 8.5 and 11 {$\mu$}m.},

  abstract = {Periodic structures of spherical silicon particles are analyzed using the coupled-dipole equations for studying optical response features and local electromagnetic fields. The model takes into account the electric and magnetic dipole moments of the particles embedded in a homogeneous dielectric medium. Particles with radius of 65 nm and larger are considered. It is shown that, due to the large permittivity of silicon, the first two Mie resonances are located in the region of visible light, where the absorption is small and the extinction is basically determined by scattering. The main contribution is given by the induced magnetic and electric dipoles of the particles. Thus, in contrast to metal particle arrays, here is a possibility to combine separately either the electric or magnetic dipole resonances of individual particles with the structural features. As a result, extinction spectra can have additional narrow resonant peaks connected with multiple light scattering by the magnetic dipoles and displaying a Fano-type resonant profile. Reflection and transmission properties of the Si particle arrays are investigated and the conditions of low light reflection and transmission by the particle arrays are discussed, as well as the applicability of the dipole approach. It is shown that the light transmission of finite-size arrays of Si particles can be significantly suppressed at the conditions of the particle magnetic dipole resonance. It is demonstrated that, using resonant conditions, one can separately control the enhancements of local electric and magnetic fields in the structures.},

  volume = {94},
  abstract = {The application of Cartesian multipoles in irreducible representations provides the possibility to get explicit contributions of the toroidal multipole terms in the extinction and scattering power without the introduction of special form factors. In the framework of the Cartesian multipoles, we obtained multipole decomposition (up to the third order) of the induced polarization (current) inside an arbitrarily shaped scatterer (nanoparticle). The third-order decomposition includes the toroidal dipole, magnetic quadrupole, electric octupole terms, and also nonradiating terms. The corresponding multipole decomposition of the scattering cross section, taking into account the electric octupole term, is derived and compared with the multipole decomposition of the extinction cross section obtained using the optical theorem. We show that the role of multipoles in the optical theorem (light extinction) and scattering by arbitrarily shaped nanoparticles can be different. This can result in seemingly paradoxical conclusions with respect to the appearance of multipole contributions in the scattering and extinction cross sections. This fact is especially important for absorptionless nanoparticles, for which the scattering cross section can be calculated using the optical theorem, because in this case extinction is solely determined by scattering. Demonstrative results concerning the role of third-order multipoles in the resonant optical response of high-refractive-index dielectric nanodisks, with and without a through hole at the center, are presented. It is shown that the optical theorem results in a negligible role of the third-order multipoles in the extinction cross sections, whereas these multipoles provide the main contribution in the scattering cross sections.},

  abstract = {Recent developments in molecular theories and simulation of ions and polar molecules in water are reviewed. The hydration of imidazole and imidazolium is used to exemplify the theoretical issues. The treatment of long-ranged electrostatic interactions in simulations is discussed extensively. It is argued that the Ewald approach is an easy way to get correct hydration free energies corresponding to thermodynamic limit from molecular calculations. Molecular simulations with Ewald interactions and periodic boundary conditions can also be more efficient than many common alternatives. The Ewald treatment permits a conclusive extrapolation to infinite system size. Accurate results for well-defined models have permitted careful testing of simple theories of electrostatic hydration free energies, such as dielectric continuum models. The picture that emerges from such testing is that the most prominent failings of the simplest theories are associated with solvent proton conformations that lead to non-Gaussian fluctuations of electrostatic potentials. Thus, the most favorable cases for second-order perturbation theories are monoatomic positive ions. For polar and anionic solutes, continuum or Gaussian theories are less accurate. The appreciation of the specific deficiencies of those simple models have led to new concepts, multistate Gaussian and quasi-chemical theories, which address the cases for which the simpler theories fail. It is argued that, relative to direct dielectric continuum treatments, the quasi-chemical theories provide a better theoretical organization for the computational study of the electronic structure of solution species.},

First, the traditional Ewald sum for 3D Coulomb systems is reviewed, then the P3M method of Hockney and Eastwood is discussed in some detail, and alternative ways of dealing with the Coulomb sum are briefly mentioned. The best strategies to perform the sum under partially periodic boundary conditions are discussed, and two recently developed methods are presented, namely the MMM2D and ELC methods for two-dimensionally periodic boundary conditions, and the MMM1D method for systems with only one periodic coordinate. The dipolar Ewald sum is also reviewed. For some of the methods, error formulas are provided which enable the algorithm to be tuned at a predefined accuracy. Open image in new window},

The transforms considered include the useful cases of the Coulomb and dipole potentials, and include situations where the transforms are singular and involve terms proportional to the Dirac delta function. Our approach makes use of the Rayleigh expansion of exp(i p.r) in terms of spherical Bessel functions, and we study a number of integrals, including singular integrals, involving a power of the independent variable times a spherical Bessel function. We work through several examples of three-dimensional Fourier transforms using our approach and show how to derive a number of identities involving multiple derivatives of 1/r, 1/r\^2, and delta(\textbackslash{}vec r).},

However, to be as useful as its Cartesian counterpart, a spherical version of the Fourier operational toolset is required for the standard operations of shift, multiplication, convolution, etc. This paper derives the spherical version of the standard Fourier operation toolset. In particular, convolution in various forms is discussed in detail as this has important consequences for filtering. It is shown that standard multiplication and convolution rules do apply as long as the correct definition of convolution is applied.},

Closed-form solutions are presented where possible, and recursion relations are developed that are guaranteed to reduce all integrals in this class to closed-form solutions.

  abstract = {Wave propagation is considered in multidimensional reciprocal space. For the first Rayleigh-Sommerfeld diffraction integral, the propagating field can be represented by homogeneous and inhomogeneous components. These add up to give a propagating component on a hemispherical surface in reciprocal space, and an evanescent component that lies totally outside the corresponding sphere. If evanescent waves can be neglected, the 3D angular spectrum method, entailing inverse Fourier transformation of the weighted hemisphere, can be used to calculate efficiently the propagated field. This basic concept is applied in spaces of different dimensionality. For functions displaying hyperspherical symmetry in nD space, the corresponding Hankel transformation leads to Hankel-transform pairs. Tables of functions relevant in wave propagation, diffraction, and information optics are presented. The two-dimensional (2D) case is particularly important as it can be applied to propagation in planar wave guides, surface plasmonics, and cross sections of propagationally invariant fields, as well as to fringe analysis and image processing in two dimensions.},

This book begins with exposition on the combinatorial and algebraic techniques that Professor Gould uses for proving binomial identities. These techniques are then applied to develop formulas which relate Stirling numbers of the second kind to Stirling numbers of the first kind. Professor Gould's techniques also provide connections between both types of Stirling numbers and Bernoulli numbers. Professor Gould believes his research success comes from his intuition on how to discover combinatorial identities.

  abstract = {The computation of the cumulative hypergeometric distribution function is of interest to many researchers who are working in the computational sciences and related areas. Presented here is a new method for computing this function that applies prime number factorization to the factorials. We also apply cancellation to the numerator and denominator to reduce the computational complexity of the initial, the tail end, or weighted probabilities to achieve maximum accuracy. The new method includes two algorithms, one using recursion and the other using iteration. These two algorithms are machine independent; precision is arbitrary, subject to storage limitation. The development of the algorithms is discussed, and some test results and the comparison of these two algorithms are given. To  implement both algorithms, we use the Ada programming language that is an American National Standard Institute standardized language. The language has special features such as exception handling and tasks. Exception handling is used to make programming easier and to prevent overflow or underflow conditions during the execution of the program. Tasks are used to compute the numerator and denominator concurrently, and to maximize the possible number of integer multiplications in the numerator and denominator. All of the computations can be done on currently available machines, and the time consumed by these computations remains reasonably small.},

  abstract = {In this review, we look at the concepts and state-of-the-art concerning the analysis of micro and nanoresonators from the underlying concept of their natural resonances, also called quasi-normal modes (QNMs). It is these modes with complex frequencies that are responsible for the spectral response and temporal dynamics of the resonators. They are initially excited by the driving near or far-field, then loaded before exponentially decaying in time due to power leakage or absorption. We explore how QNM-expansion formalisms model these basic effects, and how modal interferences give rise to complex Fano-like phenomena in the dynamics. An extensive overview of the historical background and a detailed discussion of more recent relevant theoretical and numerical advances concerning QNMs in electromagnetism is then presented. We further provide a concise description of the role of QNMs with reference to a number of examples involving electromagnetic resonant fields and matter, the modification of the local density of electromagnetic states with resonance, the weak and strong couplings of quantum oscillators with confined fields, the superradiance assisted by nanoresonators, the perturbation of resonance modes, and application of resonant modes in disordered media. We conclude our review with a perspective on the future of QNM concepts.},

  abstract = {A classical problem of free-space Green's function G 0{$\Lambda$} representations of the Helmholtz equation is studied in various quasi-periodic cases, i.e., when an underlying periodicity is imposed in less dimensions than is the dimension of an embedding space. Exponentially convergent series for the free-space quasi-periodic G 0{$\Lambda$} and for the expansion coefficients D L of G 0{$\Lambda$} in the basis of regular (cylindrical in two dimensions and spherical in three dimension (3D)) waves, or lattice sums, are reviewed and new results for the case of a one-dimensional (1D) periodicity in 3D are derived. From a mathematical point of view, a derivation of exponentially convergent representations for Schl{\"o}milch series of cylindrical and spherical Hankel functions of any integer order is accomplished. Exponentially convergent series for G 0{$\Lambda$} and lattice sums D L hold for any value of the Bloch momentum and allow G 0{$\Lambda$} to be efficiently evaluated also in the periodicity plane. The quasi-periodic Green's functions of the Laplace equation are obtained from the corresponding representations of G 0{$\Lambda$} of the Helmholtz equation by taking the limit of the wave vector magnitude going to zero. The derivation of relevant results in the case of a 1D periodicity in 3D highlights the common part which is universally applicable to any of remaining quasi-periodic cases. The results obtained can be useful for the numerical solution of boundary integral equations for potential flows in fluid mechanics, remote sensing of periodic surfaces, periodic gratings, and infinite arrays of resonators coupled to a waveguide, in many contexts of simulating systems of charged particles, in molecular dynamics, for the description of quasi-periodic arrays of point interactions in quantum mechanics, and in various ab initio first-principle multiple-scattering theories for the analysis of diffraction of classical and quantum waves.},

  abstract = {A periodic fast multipole algorithm (P-FMA) is devised for evaluating 3-D periodic Green's function (PGF) for a 2-D lattice which can be used to solve scattering by a structure with 2-D periodicity. The introduction of periodicity in the Green's function formulation produces image sources at each lattice site. Like multilevel FMA (ML-FMA), P-FMA takes advantage of the distance between image sources and observation points to factorize the field using multipoles. By substituting known factorizations of the free-space Green's function into the expression for PGF, one can isolate the summation over the lattice into the translation phase of the FMA. For both plane wave and multipole factorizations, a common term known as lattice constant appears. The lattice constant is an infinite sum over the lattice which does not converge absolutely when expressed as a spatial sum. Using the Ewald summation technique, the lattice constants can be evaluated with exponential convergence and high accuracy. The resulting P-FMA is between O(N) and O(N log N) in memory use and computational complexity, depending on the object size relative to the wavelength.},

Here elements of R are given by integrals of regular wave functions over the cylinder surface. A "Rayleigh expansion" is then found that is convergent throughout the Rayleigh region and the lower end of the resonance region and requires no matrix inversion. For bodies of high aspect ratio, there is a problem with significance loss during numerical integration, due to large oscillatory terms. A class of surfaces has now been found for which these terms can be removed, however, enabling us to treat aspect ratios up to 1000:1. These methods are expected to apply also in three dimensions.},

The main purpose of the book is to give a theoretical treatment of these scattering phenomena, and to illustrate numerical computations of some canonical scattering problems for different geometries and materials. The scattering theory is also important in the theory of passive antennas, and this book gives several examples on this topic. Topics covered include an introduction to the basic equations used in scattering; the Green functions and dyadics; integral representation of fields; introductory scattering theory; scattering in the time domain; approximations and applications; spherical vector waves; scattering by spherical objects; the null-field approach; and propagation in stratified media. The book is organised along two tracks, which can be studied separately or together. Track 1 material is appropriate for a first reading of the textbook, while Track 2 contains more advanced material suited for the second reading and for reference. Exercises are included for each chapter.},

@article{tao_relation_1998,
  title = {Relation of {{Cartesian}} and Spherical Multipole Moments in General Relativity},
  volume = {333},
  abstract = {The Earth's gravitational field is represented by its multipole moments. Multipole moments have two kinds of equivalent forms, that is, the Cartesian symmetric and trace-free tensors and the spherical harmonic coefficients. The relation between these two forms is interesting and useful for some practical problems. Under Newtonian approximation, there exists a simple relation between the aforesaid two kinds of multipole moments (see Hartmann et al., 1994, for details). But in the 1PN
approximation of general relativity, the relation mentioned above becomes complicated. This paper discusses how to turn the expansion of the 1PN Earth's gravitational potential, which consists of a scalar potential and a vector potential, in terms of BD moments into that in terms of a set of time-slowly-changing, observable multipole moments. Under a specific standard PN gauge, we derive the corresponding
expansion of the potential in terms of spherical harmonics, obtain the relation between the 1PN spherical harmonic coefficients and the
Cartesian multipole moments, and compute the expressions of the lowest order spherical harmonic coefficients including the relation between the 1PN Earth dynamical form-factor J\_2 and the BD mass quadrupole moment of the Earth. As for the 1PN vector potential, we also discuss its
expansion in terms of Cartesian multipole moments under the rigidity approximation. In this paper, we emphasize the choice of the coordinate gauge. Under our ad hoc standard PN gauge, the results have simpler form and clearer physical meaning.},
