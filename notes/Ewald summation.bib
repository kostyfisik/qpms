  abstract = {Using the specific model of a bilayer of classical charged particles (bilayer Wigner crystal), we compare the predictions for energies and pair distribution functions obtained by Monte Carlo simulations using three different methods available to treat the long range Coulomb interactions in systems periodic in two directions but bound in the third one. The three methods compared are: the Ewald method for quasi-two dimensional systems [D.E. Parry, Surf. Sci. \$$\backslash$bm\{49\}\$, 433 (1975); $\backslash$it\{ibid.\}, \$$\backslash$bm\{54\}\$, 195 (1976)], the Hautman-Klein method [J. Hautman and M.L. Klein, Mol. Phys. \$$\backslash$bm\{75\}\$, 379 (1992)] and the Lekner summations method [J. Lekner, Physica A\$$\backslash$bm\{176\}\$, 485 (1991)]. All of the three method studied in this paper may be applied to any quasi-two dimensional systems, including those having not the specific symmetry of slab systems. For the particular system used in this work, the Ewald method for quasi-two dimensional systems is exact and may be implemented with efficiency; results obtained with the other two methods are systematically compared to results found with the Ewald method. General recommendations to implement with accuracy, but not always with efficiency, the Lekner summations technique in Monte Carlo algorithms are given.},

  abstract = {Recent developments in molecular theories and simulation of ions and polar molecules in water are reviewed. The hydration of imidazole and imidazolium is used to exemplify the theoretical issues. The treatment of long-ranged electrostatic interactions in simulations is discussed extensively. It is argued that the Ewald approach is an easy way to get correct hydration free energies corresponding to thermodynamic limit from molecular calculations. Molecular simulations with Ewald interactions and periodic boundary conditions can also be more efficient than many common alternatives. The Ewald treatment permits a conclusive extrapolation to infinite system size. Accurate results for well-defined models have permitted careful testing of simple theories of electrostatic hydration free energies, such as dielectric continuum models. The picture that emerges from such testing is that the most prominent failings of the simplest theories are associated with solvent proton conformations that lead to non-Gaussian fluctuations of electrostatic potentials. Thus, the most favorable cases for second-order perturbation theories are monoatomic positive ions. For polar and anionic solutes, continuum or Gaussian theories are less accurate. The appreciation of the specific deficiencies of those simple models have led to new concepts, multistate Gaussian and quasi-chemical theories, which address the cases for which the simpler theories fail. It is argued that, relative to direct dielectric continuum treatments, the quasi-chemical theories provide a better theoretical organization for the computational study of the electronic structure of solution species.},

For the first Rayleigh-Sommerfeld diffraction integral, the propagating field can be represented by homogeneous and inhomogeneous components. These add up to give a propagating component on a hemispherical surface in reciprocal space, and an evanescent component that lies totally outside the corresponding sphere. If evanescent waves can be neglected, the 3D angular spectrum method, entailing inverse Fourier transformation of the weighted hemisphere, can be used to calculate efficiently the propagated field. This basic concept is applied in spaces of different dimensionality. For functions displaying hyperspherical symmetry in nD space, the corresponding Hankel transformation leads to Hankel-transform pairs. Tables of functions relevant in wave propagation, diffraction, and information optics are presented. The two-dimensional (2D) case is particularly important as it can be applied to propagation in planar wave guides, surface plasmonics, and cross sections of propagationally invariant fields, as well as to fringe analysis and image processing in two dimensions.},

Professor Gould's techniques also provide connections between both types of Stirling numbers and Bernoulli numbers.

  abstract = {The computation of the cumulative hypergeometric distribution function is of interest to many researchers who are working in the computational sciences and related areas. Presented here is a new method for computing this function that applies prime number factorization to the factorials. We also apply cancellation to the numerator and denominator to reduce the computational complexity of the initial, the tail end, or weighted probabilities to achieve maximum accuracy. The new method includes two algorithms, one using recursion and the other using iteration. These two algorithms are machine independent; precision is arbitrary, subject to storage limitation. The development of the algorithms is discussed, and some test results and the comparison of these two algorithms are given. To  implement both algorithms, we use the Ada programming language that is an American National Standard Institute standardized language. The language has special features such as exception handling and tasks. Exception handling is used to make programming easier and to prevent overflow or underflow conditions during the execution of the program. Tasks are used to compute the numerator and denominator concurrently, and to maximize the possible number of integer multiplications in the numerator and denominator. All of the computations can be done on currently available machines, and the time consumed by these computations remains reasonably small.},

  abstract = {A periodic fast multipole algorithm (P-FMA) is devised for evaluating 3-D periodic Green's function (PGF) for a 2-D lattice which can be used to solve scattering by a structure with 2-D periodicity. The introduction of periodicity in the Green's function formulation produces image sources at each lattice site. Like multilevel FMA (ML-FMA), P-FMA takes advantage of the distance between image sources and observation points to factorize the field using multipoles. By substituting known factorizations of the free-space Green's function into the expression for PGF, one can isolate the summation over the lattice into the translation phase of the FMA. For both plane wave and multipole factorizations, a common term known as lattice constant appears. The lattice constant is an infinite sum over the lattice which does not converge absolutely when expressed as a spatial sum. Using the Ewald summation technique, the lattice constants can be evaluated with exponential convergence and high accuracy. The resulting P-FMA is between O(N) and O(N log N) in memory use and computational complexity, depending on the object size relative to the wavelength.},

  abstract = {A classical problem of free-space Green's function G 0$\Lambda$ representations of the Helmholtz equation is studied in various quasi-periodic cases, i.e., when an underlying periodicity is imposed in less dimensions than is the dimension of an embedding space. Exponentially convergent series for the free-space quasi-periodic G 0$\Lambda$ and for the expansion coefficients D L of G 0$\Lambda$ in the basis of regular (cylindrical in two dimensions and spherical in three dimension (3D)) waves, or lattice sums, are reviewed and new results for the case of a one-dimensional (1D) periodicity in 3D are derived. From a mathematical point of view, a derivation of exponentially convergent representations for Schl\"omilch series of cylindrical and spherical Hankel functions of any integer order is accomplished. Exponentially convergent series for G 0$\Lambda$ and lattice sums D L hold for any value of the Bloch momentum and allow G 0$\Lambda$ to be efficiently evaluated also in the periodicity plane. The quasi-periodic Green's functions of the Laplace equation are obtained from the corresponding representations of G 0$\Lambda$ of the Helmholtz equation by taking the limit of the wave vector magnitude going to zero. The derivation of relevant results in the case of a 1D periodicity in 3D highlights the common part which is universally applicable to any of remaining quasi-periodic cases. The results obtained can be useful for the numerical solution of boundary integral equations for potential flows in fluid mechanics, remote sensing of periodic surfaces, periodic gratings, and infinite arrays of resonators coupled to a waveguide, in many contexts of simulating systems of charged particles, in molecular dynamics, for the description of quasi-periodic arrays of point interactions in quantum mechanics, and in various ab initio first-principle multiple-scattering theories for the analysis of diffraction of classical and quantum waves.},
