  abstract = {An analysis of radiative scattering for an arbitrary configuration of neighbouring spheres is presented. The analysis builds upon the previously developed superposition solution, in which the scattered field is expressed as a superposition of vector spherical harmonic expansions written about each sphere in the ensemble. The addition theorems for vector spherical harmonics, which transform harmonics from one coordinate system into another, are rederived, and simple recurrence relations for the addition coefficients are developed. The relations allow for a very efficient implementation of the â€˜order of scattering' solution technique for determining the scattered field coefficients for each sphere.},

  abstract = {Vector addition theorems are a necessary ingredient in the analytical solution of electromagnetic multiparticle-scattering problems. These theorems include a large number of vector addition coefficients. There exist three basic types of analytical expressions for vector translation coefficients: Stein's (Quart. Appl. Math.19, 15 (1961)), Cruzan's (Quart. Appl. Math.20, 33 (1962)), and Xu's (J. Comput. Phys.127, 285 (1996)). Stein's formulation relates vector translation coefficients with scalar translation coefficients. Cruzan's formulas use the Wigner 3jm symbol. Xu's expressions are based on the Gaunt coefficient. Since the scalar translation coefficient can also be expressed in terms of the Gaunt coefficient, the key to the expeditious and reliable calculation of vector translation coefficients is the fast and accurate evaluation of the Wigner 3jm symbol or the Gaunt coefficient. We present highly efficient recursive approaches to accurately evaluating Wigner 3jm symbols and Gaunt coefficients. Armed with these recursive approaches, we discuss several schemes for the calculation of the vector translation coefficients, using the three general types of formulation, respectively. Our systematic test calculations show that the three types of formulas produce generally the same numerical results except that the algorithm of Stein's type is less accurate in some particular cases. These extensive test calculations also show that the scheme using the formulation based on the Gaunt coefficient is the most efficient in practical computations.},

The theory is classical but, except when the group was very small or had a rather special structure, the actual computations were prohibitive before the advent of high-speed computers; and there remain practical difficulties even for groups of relatively small orders . The present paper describes three techniques to help solve this problem. These are: the reduction of a reducible unitary representation into its irreducible components; the construction of a complete set of irreducible unitary representations from a single faithful representation; and the calculation of the precise values of a group character from values which have only been computed approximately.},
